## Projects
These are my two projects using Machine Learning.

## UFC Fight Predictor

Uses all the historical fight statistics from the very first UFC to 2021. The machine learning model discovered the features that are significant to a fight outcome.
The regression model will help predict future fight outcomes based on the fighters and weightclass.

## DJIA Stock Predictor
This model was initially a  NLP problem looking at Reddit News Headlines and determining if there was any correlation between the headlines and the DJIA price movement. Then the analysis swithced over to a technical analysis to determine features that helped predict the daily closing prices. The regression model attempts to predict the future trend and closing prices of the DJIA in the future.
