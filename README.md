# Projects
These are my two projects using Machine Learning.

# UFC Fight Predictor

Uses all the historical fight statistics from the very first UFC to 2021. The machine learning model discovered the features that are significant to a fight outcome.
The regression model will help predict future fight outcomes based on the fighters and weightclass.

# DJIA Stock Predictor
This model uses technical analysis to determine features that helped predict the daily closing prices. The regression model attempts to predict the future trend and closing prices of the DJIA in the future.
