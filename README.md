The UFC is a very interesting sport and there has been some statistics collected on sport since it first appearred in the 1990s.  

The dataset uses all the historical fight statistics from the very first UFC to 2021. Every elbow, takedown, KO, submission, head shot, significant strike and otehr moves have been recorded and in the data set. The goal of this project was to apply machine learning to help predict the outcome of future fights. 

### Let's look at some exploratory data!

Looking at the chart above we can see the number of KOs by age for the welterweights. The fighters peak around the age of 27-28 for the most KOs.

The chart above shows the number of significant strikes versus number of KOs for all the weight classes. The most number of KOs occur between 12 to 100 significant strikes. 

The machine learning model discovered the features that are significant to a fight outcome.
The regression model will help predict future fight outcomes based on the fighters, date of the fight and weightclass.
