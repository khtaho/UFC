# Projects
These are my two projects using Machine Learning.

# UFC Fight Predictor#
Uses all the historical fight statistics from the first UFC to about 2020 to learn the features that are significant to a fight outcome.
The model will help predict future fight outcomes based on the fight names and weightclass

# DJIA Stock Predictor#
This model uses technical analysis to determine features that helped predict the daily closing prices. The model attempts to predict the future trend and closing prices of the DJIA in the future.
